              Shaver Lake is a popular recreational lake surrounded by thick
              pine forests of the Sierra National Forest. Southern California
              Edison (SCE) owns the lands around Shaver Lake and administers
              recreation sites at that location.​ Operated by SCE it provides
              opportunities for boating camping, hiking, fishing, sightseeing.

              Shaver Lake was constructed by the Pacific Light and Power
              Corporation, later named Southern California Edison in 1927.
              Shaver Lake is part of the Big Creek Hydroelectric project which
              includes a system of lakes, tunnels, steel penstocks and power
              houses that convert water into electricity.

              The ideal camping time in most Forest areas is May to October, prior to winter storm activity. Reservation campgrounds are available, however some Forest campgrounds are operated on a first-come, first-served system. The maximum stay in most campgrounds is 14 days with a 21 day maximum stay per Ranger District, per calendar year. Most campgrounds fill quickly during holiday weekends, therefore visitors should come prepared to camp in undeveloped areas.

              When in campgrounds, public beaches or on trails local ordinances require pets to be leashed. As a consideration to others, please refrain from taking pets to beach areas to prevent contamination. Domestic pets are allowed in wilderness areas. You are responsible for their actions as well as their welfare. Pets should either be leashed or under direct voice control.

              The start of the California Gold Rush in 1848 and the sudden influx of miners in search of their fortune spread out across the Sierra Nevada.  With so much gold being found in the streams, miners expected that somewhere in the mountains was the “Mother Lode”, the veins of gold in hard rock.  This search in the streams and rocks extended all the way south into what is now the Sierra National Forest.
